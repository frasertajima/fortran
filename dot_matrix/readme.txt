Developed a cp.dot(a,a) drop in replacement for cupy and numpy dot matrix multiplication library. It trades a tiny bit of accuracy for a huge speedup. I was getting annoyed with very long numpy and cupy operations in machine learning. A version that maintains perfect accuracy was also developed but there was no point as it was only a tiny bit faster than cupy.
Distributing compiled version and testing notebook for now as it undergoes testing. Binary exponention commented in the notebooks is not being used in this instance (it is a different version).
