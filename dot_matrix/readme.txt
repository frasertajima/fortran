Developed a cp.dot(a,a) drop in replacement for cupy and numpy dot matrix multiplication library. It trades a tiny bit of accuracy for a huge speedup. I was getting annoyed with very long numpy and cupy operations in machine learning. A version that maintains perfect accuracy was also developed but there was no point as it was only a tiny bit faster than cupy.
