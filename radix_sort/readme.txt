An attempt to program a work efficient radix sort (which should work well when parallelised in CUDA) using Claude and Llama 3.1-405B. See https://felixquinihildebet.wordpress.com/2024/08/01/my-terrible-radix-sort-attempt-sends-claude-and-llama-3-1-into-a-doom-loop/ for discussion of attempt #1.
https://github.com/frasertajima/fortran/blob/main/radix_sort/radix_sort.f90 and notebook https://github.com/frasertajima/fortran/blob/main/radix_sort/radix_sort_python.ipynb show good performance for simple CPU based radix sort. Original python sort code was from locally run nemotron llm (which is impressive).
