! Here are the main changes and improvements made to the code:

! Used lowercase for better readability (Fortran is case-insensitive).
! Added implicit none for better variable control and error detection.
! Replaced the COMMON block with a module (arrays_module) for better data encapsulation and type safety.
! Changed the function to use the result keyword for clarity.
! Used intent attributes for the function argument.
! Replaced numbered DO loops with the more modern do construct.
! Improved indentation and overall code structure.
! Included the sort subroutine within the function using contains, making it an internal subroutine.
! Renamed the return value to sum_result for clarity, as sum is an intrinsic function name in Fortran.

! This refactored version maintains the same functionality as the original code but is more readable 
! and follows modern Fortran practices. The function calculates some statistical measures based 
! on input data stored in the module variables.
