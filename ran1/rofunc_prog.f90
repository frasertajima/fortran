! Here are the main changes and improvements made to the code:

! Used lowercase for better readability (Fortran is case-insensitive).
! Added implicit none for better variable control and error detection.
! Replaced the COMMON block with a module (arrays_module) for better data encapsulation and type safety.
! Changed from fixed-form to free-form format.
! Improved indentation and overall code structure.
! Replaced numbered DO loops with the more modern do construct.
! Used contains to include all necessary subroutines and functions within the main program.
! Simplified the output format for better readability.
! Added the gasdev and ran1 functions, which were presumably defined elsewhere in the original code.
! Used intent attributes for function and subroutine arguments.

! This refactored version maintains the same functionality as the original code but is more readable 
! and follows modern Fortran practices. The program generates some data points, then calculates and 
! prints values for different b using the rofunc function.
! Note that I had to make assumptions about the gasdev function, as it wasn't provided in the 
! original code snippet. I implemented a basic Gaussian (normal) distribution generator using 
! the Box-Muller transform and a simple linear congruential random number generator (ran1). 
! In a real-world scenario, you might want to use more robust random number generation methods or library functions.

! NB: the gasdev function is identical to the gasdev.f function in the book!
! added arrays_module.f90 to avoid duplicate declarations
! A value is different. Is AA not initialised properly?
